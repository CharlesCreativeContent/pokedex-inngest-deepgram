# ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¤ Pokedex Inngest Deepgram

This is a **PokÃ©mon PokÃ©dex demo app** built with **Next.js**, **Inngest**, **Deepgram**, and **OpenAI**. It demonstrates how to orchestrate an AI-powered workflowâ€”such as transcribing audio and generating intelligent responsesâ€”using the [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com) cloud platform.

> âš¡ Run it locally to interact with the PokÃ©dex via **voice or text**, and observe each workflow step in real-time using Inngestâ€™s Dev UI.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Local Development

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokedex-inngest-deepgram.git
cd pokedex-inngest-deepgram
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

(You can also use `yarn` or `pnpm`.)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and include your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=<your-inngest-event-key>
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your-deepgram-key>
```

Youâ€™ll need to get keys from:

- ðŸ”‘ [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- ðŸ”‘ [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/)
- ðŸ”‘ [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/signup)

---

### 4. Start the Next.js Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

### 5. Run the Inngest Dev Server

In a new terminal window:

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

This launches Inngest Dev Server (defaults to [http://localhost:8288](http://localhost:8288)).

---

### 6. Open the Inngest Dev UI

Visit [http://localhost:8288](http://localhost:8288) to monitor your events and functions.

---

### 7. Use the PokÃ©dex App

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Interact with the PokÃ©dex:
  - ðŸŽ™ Speak a PokÃ©monâ€™s name or question (uses Deepgram for voice recognition)
  - ðŸ’¬ Type in a question about a PokÃ©mon
- ðŸ“¡ The app uses:
  - Deepgram to transcribe voice
  - OpenAI to generate responses
  - Inngest to coordinate the workflow
- ðŸ§ª Watch events and functions update live in the Inngest Dev UI

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Vercel

Click below to deploy to Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project)

Youâ€™ll be prompted to:

- Clone the repository
- Enter your environment variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`
  - `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`

After deployment, access your live app via the Vercel-provided URL.

> In production, use the [Inngest Cloud Dashboard](https://app.inngest.com) for monitoring instead of the local Dev UI.
